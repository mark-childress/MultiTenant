Users want both, but sometimes the interplay between design and performance feels like a fixed sum game: one side's gain is the other side's loss. Design and performance are indeed connected, but it's more like the yin and yang. They aren't opposing forces, but instead complement each other. Users want an experience that is rich and fast. The trick for designers and developers is figuring out how to do that.</p>\n\n<p>The answer is to adopt an approach that considers both design and performance from the outset. With this approach, designs are conceived by teams of designers and developers working together. Developers benefit by participating in the product definition process. Designers benefit from understanding more about how designs are implemented. There's an emphasis on early prototyping and tracking performance from the get go.</p>\n\n      <p>With new metrics that focus on what a user actually sees as the page loads, we can now bridge the technical and language gaps that have hindered the seamless creation of great user experiences.

Web applications are no longer being built to cater to human interaction, but now must adapt to be able to handle machine-to-machine communications. This new requirement has placed a dramatic emphasis on API interfaces and has even ushered in a new development methodology called API first development.\n\nAs a result, JavaScript has risen to the forefront as the ideal language due to its ability to perform under the high concurrency and event-driven I/O required by the multitude of devices being integrated onto the web. This rise in relevancy for JavaScript has, in turn, created a number of technologies that span the entire web application stack to provide the ideal platform to build the next generation of Web 3.0 applications. This web application stack is commonly referred to as the M.E.A.N stack and is more than just another web application framework. It is an answer to the glaring problem of web applications needing to support high concurrency requests from a multitude of devices, and serves as the ideal platform for what is being called Web 3.0.\n\nThis presentation will walk you through all the latest trends within Web Development and provide an in-depth introduction to the M.E.A.N architecture. In addition, we will walk through how to build a next generation, API-first, web application that is built for the future. ",

Angular does all of the heavy lifting for you to pave the road towards building a SPA. This workshop explores the core pieces that help you build end-to-end SPA solutions using Angular including code structure and modularity, using data binding and MV*, abstracted remote data calls, page navigation and routing, rich data features, and responsive design. Throughout the workshop, you’ll learn how to build robust SPA applications with Angular. You’ll see several focused demos and full-featured apps that will help you learn and understand the role of key Angular components such as modules, controllers, factories, directives, and more. </p>\n\n<p>The workshop will also discuss new features coming in Angular 2.0 and the role that TypeScript will play. </p>\n\n<p>This workshop covers: </p>\n\n<ul>\n   <li>SPA fundamentals </li>\n\n <li>Importance of Separation of Concerns (SoC) </li> \n\n <li>JavaScript patterns for creating organized code </li> \n\n <li>Key components of AngularJS </li>\n\n <li>How directives can be used </li>\n\n <li>The role of views, controllers, and $scope </li> \n\n <li>Managing remote data calls using services</li>\n\n <li>The role of modules and how they can be used </li>\n\n <li>Routing and page navigation </li> \n\n <li>Data binding </li> \n\n <li>Navigating and app lifecycle </li> \n\n <li>Debugging tips</li> \n\n <li>Preparing for Angular 2.0</li> \n\n <li>TypeScript fundamentals</li>\n</ul>",
